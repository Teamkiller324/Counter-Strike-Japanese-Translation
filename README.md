# Counter-Strike 日本語 Translation (Should be CS2 Compatible)
   - Translated from scratch to japanese, because the default is missing alot of translations.
Unused translation strings are removed.
   - Will be updated as frequently as possible, to remain relevant to the game's latest updates.
   - Corrections are very much appreciated. 👍
   - ありがとうございます！

### Setup
   - Drop in the translation text files onto \csgo\resource\ directory.
