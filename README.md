# Counter-Strike 日本語 Translation (Should be CS2 Compatible)
Translated from scratch to japanese. Because the default is missing alot of translations.
Unused translation strings are removed.

Will be updated as frequently as possible, to remain relevant to the game's latest updates. Corrections are very much appreciated.

```Drop in the translation text files onto \csgo\resource\ directory. Than add '-language japanese_improved' to launch parameter.```

## Currently alot of translation lines yet to be translated, roughly 80-85% finished.
   - Certain UI (User-Inferface) localizations yet to be translated.
   - Navigation place names yet fully translated.
   - Majority of skins yet translated.
   - Very well is in usable state.
